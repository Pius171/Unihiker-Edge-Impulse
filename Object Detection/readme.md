# Connecting Unihiker to Edge Impulse
**Before moving on, do note that none of the commands below will work if edge-impule-linux is not installed**
Open a terminal on Unihiker and send the command below to connect to Edge Impulse. Make sure a USB camera is attached before sending the command.

```
edge-impulse-linux

# Data Collection
If the above steps worked well you should now be able to collect data with your camera

# Labelling
During data collection, data is not labelled, so you might have to label each image manually. You can try out AI labelling, but I have not been able to get it to work.

You can find the edge impulse project at this (link)[https://studio.edgeimpulse.com/studio/758556]
All data used for the project can be found in the Edge Impulse project. 
I did not bother uploading the samples as I got them from an edge impulse documentation, and they were already in edge impulse format[json]; so it is the same as what is on the edge impulse project
Live inference was done using Edge Impulse. Check the home directory of this repo to see how to connect unihiker to Edge Impulse
